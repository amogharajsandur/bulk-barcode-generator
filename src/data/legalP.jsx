      <p>Your privacy is our priority. Here is how we handle your data:</p>
      <h3>Local Processing</h3>
      <p>Maximum privacy: Every piece of data you enter is processed 100% locally on your machine using JavaScript. We don't have a backend to store your data.</p>
      <h3>No Tracking</h3>
      <p>We do not use cookies or tracking scripts that identify you personally. Your theme preference is saved in your browser's local storage.</p>
      <h3>Open Source</h3>
      <p>Since the project is open source, you can audit the code yourself to verify these privacy claims.</p>
